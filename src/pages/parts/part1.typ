#part[Foundations] <sec:part:foundations>

In this first part of the book we're building the foundational strategies on
which the rest of the book will build and elaborate. In @sec:adt we look at
algebraic data types, which are our main way of modelling data. We turn to
codata in @sec:codata, which is the opposite, or dual, or algebraic data. Type
classes are the focus on @sec:type-classes, while fundamentals of interpreters
are discussed in @sec:interpreters. These four strategies all describe code
artifacts. For example, we can label part of code as an algebraic data type or a
type class. We'll also see strategies that help us write code but don't
necessarily end up directly reflected in it, such as following the types.
