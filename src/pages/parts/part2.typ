#part[Type Classes] <sec:part:type-classes>

In this part of the book we move on to type classes.
We looked at the implementation of type classes in @sec:type-classes.
Our focus here is on a handful of specific type classes,
that are both very useful for day-to-day programming tasks
and as conceptual models that can drive program design.
In this part we'll be looking more at their use for day-to-day programming,
while the case studies will focus on their role in design.

In @sec:cats we introduce the #link("https://typelevel.org/cats")[Cats] library.
Cats provides implementation of the type classes we're interested in,
and so it saves a lot of time and typing to use it.
